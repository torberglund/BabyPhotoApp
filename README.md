Baby Daily Photo App - Specification and Execution Plan
________________________________________
üìå Purpose
Create an Android app used by two parents to capture one curated photo per day of their newborn. Each photo is framed consistently using face detection and can be marked as the ‚Äúactive‚Äù shot for the day. Photos are stored on a shared NAS and used to build a time-lapse movie.

‚Ä¢	Sync all photos to user-owned NAS with no vendor lock-in.
‚Ä¢	Build a movie using only ‚Äúactive‚Äù photos.
